# This repo is my submission for the SPM exam of Unipi

Using FastFlow to parallelize the application of a filter via OpenCV

parallel.cpp is the parallel implementation

sequential.cpp is a simplesequential implementation

the current filter is just flipping the video frames and inverting their pixels intensities,but of course it is easy to modify this

check out build.sh for building and running either of the files.

Thanks.
